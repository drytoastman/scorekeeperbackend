Barcode printing has been tested with the PT-2730 label printer under Windows 10.  Below are some examples of good and bad barcodes.

A bad barcode will not have the minimum quiet area (whitespace) on the left and right of the barcode and/or the sizing of the black lines are larger than they should be.
