# Onsite Results/Registration

## Connecting

To connect to onsite registration or results, you must connect your device to
the local WiFi for your event.  The WiFi name is usually related to the club
running the event.  There may be multiple WiFi networks onsite:

1. at the timing van which provides results 
2. possibly one at registration which allows you to create a profile and cars

Note: You may need to disable cellular data or switch to airplane mode and
then enable Wifi for some of the following things to work

## Results

For results, if the event has an appropriate router, you can put "**results/**"
into your browser and you will be redirected to the main results page on the
local data entry machine.

If the event does not have this functionality, you will need to find out what
the IP address is for the data entry machine and enter that into your browser,
somthing like "**192.168.1.2**".

The results site is just like the site on the main server, select the necessary
series and event from the drop down menus.  You can then select any of the
event result pages for the event.


## Registration

For registration, if the event has an appropriate router, you can put
"**register/**" into your browser and you will be redirected to the
registration page on a local machine running Registration.

If the event does not have this functionality, you will need to find out what
the IP address is for the registation machine and enter that into your browser,
somthing like "**192.168.1.101**".

Once on the registation page, the interface is just like the main Scorekeeper
website except that you cannot actually register/unregister cars.  You can only
create and edit profiles and cars.  An example of what you can do to make the
whole registation process go faster is to create a new car entry when you
decided to drive someone elses car the day of.  The registation worker will
need to do actual registration.
