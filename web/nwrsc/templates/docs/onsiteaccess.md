# Onsite Results and Registration

## Connecting to WiFi network

The first thing to do is to connect your device to the correct wireless network.
For the NWR region, current networks are:

 * **NWRSCCA** - the network in the timing vehicle
 * **Registration** - the network at the registration table

## Finding the correct site

For scorekeeper enhanced routers like the above WiFi networks respond to special host requests.  Open your browser and enter one
of the following, **including the forward slash at the end**:

 * **results/**  to get redirected to the results page on the first known results machine
 * **register/** to get redirected to the registration page on the first known registration machine

If the appropriate system cannot be found, a page listing all of the discovered scorekeeper systems will be shown instead.

## Onsite Registration

Once on the onsite registration page, it behaves the same as if you were online.
