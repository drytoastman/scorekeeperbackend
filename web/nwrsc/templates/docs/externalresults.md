# Adding External Results

When results from an external event need to be included for championship
points, head to the admin page at <https://scorekeeper.wwscc.org/admin/> and
select the series you are updating.  A password will be required if you haven't
logging in before.

From there, select the event to update from the **Events** menu.  If the event
is marked as external, you will see something like the following:


![ExternalResultsPage](images/addexternal.png)

There are three form fields to fill for each new external result:

 1. the drivers list will contain all those that have participated in the series already
 2. the class list will be the local class that you want to apply the results too
 3. the empty box will is for the **net indexed and penalized time** you are applying

Enter all the data for an entrant and click Add.

Repeat this procedure for all the external results you wish to apply.
