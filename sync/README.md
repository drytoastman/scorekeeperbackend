This is a single image merge service component of ScorekeeperBackend.  It contains a local threaded process
that connects to off system database and attempts to keep all of them in sync.  Its also responsible for the
merges to/from the main server.  The Java GUI connects via a simple python 3 http server.

For development, see the README in the root directory of https://github.com/drytoastman/scorekeeperbackend
