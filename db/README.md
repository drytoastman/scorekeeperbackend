This is a single image postgresql component of ScorekeeperBackend.  It contains the sql files for creating 
tables, triggers, etc as well as generating a self-signed cert for non-verified SSL connections (just to hide
passwords from evesdroppers).

For development, see the README in the root directory of https://github.com/drytoastman/scorekeeperbackend
