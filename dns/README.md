This is a single image dns server component of ScorekeeperBackend.  It gets
information about itself and neighboring Scorekeeper instances from the
frontend and uses that information to serve up DNS records for things like
'results' and 'register'.

For development, see the README in the root directory of https://github.com/drytoastman/scorekeeperbackend
